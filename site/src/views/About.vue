    The Wayland High School Computer Science Club meets twice a week virtually, via Zoom. We have __ members, and offer a space for newer programmers to learn and more experienced programmers to try out new things. The club focusses on a variety of fields, including web development, game development, AI, and competitive programming. Commitment is only as large as you want it to be, so don't be afraid to join if you're already in other clubs!
