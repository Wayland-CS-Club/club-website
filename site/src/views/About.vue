        <h2>
          The Wayland High School Computer Science Club meets twice a week
          virtually, via Zoom. We have 10+ members, and offer a space for newer
          programmers to learn and more experienced programmers to try out new
          things. The club focusses on a variety of fields, including web
          development, game development, AI, and competitive programming. Commitment
          is only as large as you want it to be, so don't be afraid to join if
          you're already in other clubs!
